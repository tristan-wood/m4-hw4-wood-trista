            <p>Way was born in Summit, New Jersey on April 9, 1977. His parents are named Donna Lee and Donald Way. He also has a brother, Mikey Way.</p>
            <p>When he was in elementary school, he loved Bon Jovi. The first musical act he saw perform live was Bruce Springsteen. His love for musica showed itself early, as he and his brother began performing publically in the 4th grade.</p>
            <p>He originally wanted to be a guitarist. His grandmother bought him his first guitar at the age of eight. However, he at first decided to pursue a career in the comic book industry after graduating high school, attending the School of Visual Arts in New York City and graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1999.</p>

            <p>Way was working as an intern for Cartoon Network in New York City on the day of September 11, 2001. He was downtown when the planes hit the towers.</p>
            <p>In an interview with Slate magazine, Way said the tragedy was what pushed him to pursue the music he always wanted to create.</p>
            <p>"I literally said to myself, 'F*** art. I've gotta get out of the basement. I've gotta see the world. I've gotta make a difference.'" he said during the interview.</p>
            <p>Way formed the band with drummer Matt Pelissier. The two were joined by Way's brother Mikey as bassist and Ray Toro as the band's guitarist.</p>
            <p>The group released its first studio album in 2002. The group grew in popularity until reaching its peak in 2006 with the release of their most famous album, "The Black Parade".</p>

            <h2 class="title">Band Breakup</h2>
            <p>On March 22, 2013, the band announced their break-up on their official website, issuing this statement:</p>

               <p>"Being in this band for the past 12 years has been a true blessing. We've gotten to go places we never knew we would. We've been able to see and experience things we never imagined possible. We've shared the stage with people we admire, people we look up to, and best of all, our friends. And now, like all great things, it has come time for it to end. Thanks for all of your support, and for being part of the adventure."</p>
               <p>A year after the split, Way insisted the split was "nobody's fault".</p>
               <p>Years later, he told The Guardian the breakup was caused after its members had stopped having fun.</p>
               <p>"It wasn’t fun to make stuff any more," he said. "I think breaking up the band broke us out of that machine.”</p>
